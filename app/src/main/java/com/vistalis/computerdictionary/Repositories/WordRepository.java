Mediterranean piracy was conducted almost entirely with galleys until the mid-17th century, when they were gradually replaced with highly maneuverable sailing vessels such as xebecs and brigantines. They were, however, of a smaller type than battle galleys, often referred to as galiots or fustas. Pirate galleys were small, nimble, lightly armed, but often heavily manned in order to overwhelm the often minimal crews of merchant ships. In general, pirate craft were extremely difficult for patrolling craft to actually hunt down and capture. Anne Hilarion de Tourville, a French admiral of the 17th century, believed that the only way to run down raiders from the infamous corsair Moroccan port of Salé was by using a captured pirate vessel of the same type. Using oared vessels to combat pirates was common, and was even practiced by the major powers in the Caribbean. Purpose-built galleys (or hybrid sailing vessels) were built by the English in Jamaica in 1683 and by the Spanish in the late 16th century. Specially-built sailing frigates with oar-ports on the lower decks, like the James Galley and Charles Galley, and oar-equipped sloops proved highly useful for pirate hunting, though they were not built in sufficient numbers to check piracy until the 1720s.");

A table is in 4NF if and only if, for every one of its non-trivial multivalued dependencies X {\\displaystyle \\twoheadrightarrow }  \"\\twoheadrightarrow Y, X is a superkey—that is, X is either a candidate key or a superset thereof.");

The ideas behind it were published in August 2002 in a white paper titled Monad Manifesto. Monad was to be a new extensible CLI with a fresh design that would be capable of automating a full range of core administrative tasks. Microsoft first showed off Monad at the Professional Development Conference in Los Angeles in October 2003. A private beta program began a few months later which eventually led to a public beta program.");

        WordRepository.create(context,"Sun Java","The source code for Sun\'s implementations of Java (i.e. the de facto reference implementation) has been available for some time, but until recently,[when?] the license terms severely restricted what could be done with it without signing (and generally paying for) a contract with Sun. As such these terms did not satisfy the requirements of either the Open Source Initiative or the Free Software Foundation to be considered open source or free software, and Sun Java was therefore a proprietary platform.");

        WordRepository.create(context,"SiS 730","The SiS 630 and SiS 730 are a family of highly integrated chipsets for Intel (Slot 1/Socket 370) and AMD (Slot A/Socket A) respectively. At the time of release they were unique in that they not only provided VGA, Audio, LAN, IDE and USB functionality on board, but were also in a single-chip solution. At the time of release (1999) most chipsets were composed of physically separate north-bridge and south-bridge chips (technically these still existed in the SiS 630/730 but were contained in a single package). Only later have single-chip solutions become popular in the mainstream, with chipsets such as the nVidia nForce4.");

It provides the appointment calendar functions usual for any PDA. The intent of Windows CE was to provide an environment for applications compatible with the Microsoft Windows operating system, on processors better suited to low-power operation in a portable device. Originally announced in 1996, the Handheld PC is distinct from its more recent counterparts such as the Palm-Size PC, Pocket PC, or smartphone in that the specification provides for larger screen sizes as well as a keyboard.");
